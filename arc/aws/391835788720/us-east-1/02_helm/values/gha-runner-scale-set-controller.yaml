## If `metrics:` object is not provided, or commented out, the following flags
## will be applied the controller-manager and listener pods with empty values:
## `--metrics-addr`, `--listener-metrics-addr`, `--listener-metrics-endpoint`.
## This will disable metrics.

## To enable metrics, uncomment the following lines.

  ## The maximum number of concurrent reconciles which can be run by the EphemeralRunner controller.
  # Increase this value to improve the throughput of the controller.
  # It may also increase the load on the API server and the external service (e.g. GitHub API).

  ## Defines how the controller should handle upgrades while having running jobs.
  ##
  ## The strategies available are:
  ## - "immediate": (default) The controller will immediately apply the change causing the
  ##   recreation of the listener and ephemeral runner set. This can lead to an
  ##   overprovisioning of runners, if there are pending / running jobs. This should not
  ##   be a problem at a small scale, but it could lead to a significant increase of
  ##   resources if you have a lot of jobs running concurrently.
  ##
  ## - "eventual": The controller will remove the listener and ephemeral runner set
  ##   immediately, but will not recreate them (to apply changes) until all
  ##   pending / running jobs have completed.
  ##   This can lead to a longer time to apply the change but it will ensure
  ##   that you don't have any overprovisioning of runners.
  updateStrategy: "eventual"

  ## Defines a list of prefixes that should not be propagated to internal resources.
  ## This is useful when you have labels that are used for internal purposes and should not be propagated to internal resources.
  ## See https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/issues/3533 for more information.
  ##
  ## By default, all labels are propagated to internal resources
  ## Labels that match prefix specified in the list are excluded from propagation.
