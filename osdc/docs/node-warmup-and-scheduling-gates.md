# Node Warm-Up and Scheduling Gates

## Overview

When Karpenter provisions a new runner node, several initialization steps must complete before the node can accept GitHub Actions workflow jobs. These steps are orchestrated through Kubernetes-native mechanisms — startup taints, DaemonSets, and init containers — with no reliance on EC2 userdata or bootstrap scripts.

The system guarantees that every runner node has a warm git cache, patched runner-container-hooks, containerd registry mirrors, and optimized CPU/GPU settings before any workflow job is dispatched to it.

## Full Startup Timeline

```
Node provisioned by Karpenter

├─ startupTaint applied: git-cache-not-ready=true:NoSchedule

│
└─ Runner pod starts:
   └─ initContainer: wait-for-hooks
      polls /mnt/host-hooks/dist/index.js every 10s (timeout 300s),
      then snapshots /mnt/host-hooks/dist/ → /opt/runner-hooks/dist/ (emptyDir)
      └─ Runner container starts → registers with GitHub → picks up job
         └─ OSDC wrapper.js → runner-container-hooks create job pod (25 min timeout)
```

## Scheduling Gates

### Gate 1: Git Cache (Startup Taint)

**Mechanism**: Karpenter startup taint (`git-cache-not-ready=true:NoSchedule`)

Every Karpenter NodePool applies this startup taint via the `startupTaints` field in the NodePool spec. Runner pods tolerate this taint but job pods do not — the taint prevents premature scheduling.

**Defined in**: `modules/nodepools/scripts/python/generate_nodepools.py` (hardcoded in the template for every generated NodePool)

**Removed by**: `git-cache-warmer` DaemonSet (`base/kubernetes/git-cache/`)

**Flow**:
1. DaemonSet pod starts on the new node (tolerates the taint)
2. Resolves the headless service DNS for the central git-cache StatefulSet (multi-replica — e.g. 5 replicas for arc-cbr-production, configured via `git_cache.central_replicas` in `clusters.yaml`), queries each replica's metrics endpoint, and picks the one with the fewest active connections
3. Waits for the chosen central replica's rsyncd to accept TCP connections (600s timeout)
4. Rsyncs bare git repos from that replica to local NVMe at `/mnt/git-cache` using dual-slot rotation (cache-a / cache-b with atomic symlink swap)
5. On successful initial sync, removes the taint via Kubernetes API JSON Patch (RFC 6902 `test` + `remove` — atomic, race-safe)
6. Enters periodic refresh loop (every 300s)

**If sync fails**: Retries with exponential backoff (30s, 60s, 120s... capped at 300s). The node stays tainted indefinitely until a successful sync. Runner pods will not schedule.

**RBAC**: The `git-cache-warmer` ServiceAccount has `get` + `patch` on `nodes` (`base/kubernetes/git-cache/rbac.yaml`).

### Gate 2: Patched Hooks (Init Container Poll)

**Mechanism**: `wait-for-hooks` init container in every runner pod

Runner pods include an init container that polls for a file on the host filesystem before the runner container can start. This file is placed by a DaemonSet.

**DaemonSet**: `runner-hooks-warmer` (`modules/arc-runners/kubernetes/hooks-warmer.yaml`)
- Downloads patched `runner-container-hooks` v0.8.10 from GitHub releases
- Extracts to `/mnt/runner-container-hooks/dist/` on host NVMe
- Validates `dist/index.js` exists after extraction
- Writes version marker for idempotency
- Pinned via `nodeSelector: node-fleet: c7i-runner` — runs only on the dedicated c7i-runner pool, where runner pods live. Workflow-pool nodes and GPU runner pools (g4dn/g5/g6/p4d/p5/p6) do NOT get this DaemonSet because runner pods never schedule there.

**Init container**: `wait-for-hooks` (`modules/arc-runners/templates/runner.yaml.tpl`)
- Polls `/mnt/host-hooks/dist/index.js` every 10 seconds
- Timeout: 300 seconds (5 minutes) — pod fails on timeout
- Two-volume snapshot pattern:
  - `patched-hooks` — hostPath `/mnt/runner-container-hooks`, mounted read-only at `/mnt/host-hooks` (init container only)
  - `hooks-snapshot` — emptyDir (50Mi limit), mounted RW at `/opt/runner-hooks` for the init container, then RO at `/opt/runner-hooks` for the runner container
- After polling succeeds, the init container `cp -a /mnt/host-hooks/dist/ /opt/runner-hooks/dist/` (and copies the `.version` marker), then verifies `index.js` exists in the snapshot. The runner container only ever sees the emptyDir snapshot — it does not touch the hostPath directly.

**Wrapper indirection**: The runner's `ACTIONS_RUNNER_CONTAINER_HOOKS` env var points to `/home/runner/hook-extensions/wrapper.js` (the OSDC wrapper, mounted from a ConfigMap), NOT directly at `/opt/runner-hooks/dist/index.js`. The wrapper validates env vars (rate-limit responses, HTML error pages) and surfaces clearer exit codes, then spawns the real hooks at `/opt/runner-hooks/dist/index.js`.

**Why patched hooks**: The upstream `actions/runner-container-hooks` has a performance bug (`find -exec stat {} \;` instead of `find -exec stat {} +`) causing 10-100x slower workspace initialization. The patched version fixes this. This gate is temporary — remove when upstream merges the fix.

## Node-Compactor Interaction

The node-compactor (`base/node-compactor/`) can taint nodes with `node-compactor.osdc.io/consolidating=true:NoSchedule` when they are underutilized. Neither runner nor workflow pods tolerate this taint, so a compactor-tainted node is effectively dead for new scheduling.

**Protection for fresh nodes**: The compactor has a `min_node_age` grace period set per-cluster via `node_compactor.min_node_age_seconds` in `clusters.yaml` (the deploy script in `base/node-compactor/deploy.sh` falls back to `900` seconds / 15 minutes if unset). Nodes younger than this threshold are:
1. Skipped entirely during compaction evaluation
2. Forcibly untainted if somehow already tainted

This ensures freshly provisioned nodes complete their full warm-up sequence (git cache sync, hooks download, registry config) and have time to run at least one job before the compactor can consider them for consolidation.

**Why 15 minutes**: The startup taint (`git-cache-not-ready`) is removed once the initial git-cache sync completes — typically on the order of a couple of minutes, depending on cache size and central-replica load. The runner pod then starts and creates a workflow pod. A 15-minute grace period provides ample margin for the full startup-to-job-completion cycle, preventing the compactor from tainting nodes that are still serving their first job.

**Failure mode without sufficient grace period**: If `min_node_age` is too short, the compactor can taint nodes while they are still in the warm-up window or running their first job. When combined with the Karpenter startup-taint deadlock (Karpenter ignores startup taints in provisioning decisions), this can leave workflow pods with no schedulable node — causing "backoff timeout" failures.

## Non-Gating DaemonSets

These DaemonSets also run on new nodes but do not block runner scheduling:

### NodeLocal DNSCache (NLD)

**File**: `base/kubernetes/nodelocaldns/` (deployed via `base/kubernetes/nodelocaldns/deploy.sh`, invoked from the `deploy-base` just recipe — last step, after `image-cache-janitor`)

Per-node CoreDNS cache running as a DaemonSet on **every** node. Reduces cluster-wide DNS load and lowers per-pod resolution latency. Pod spec uses `priorityClassName: system-node-critical` so it lands early and won't be evicted under kubelet pressure. Resource footprint is `25m` CPU / `100Mi` memory requests, no limits (memory limit risks OOMKill → orphan iptables → cluster-wide DNS degradation).

**Why no startup taint blocks workloads on NLD readiness**: NLD operates in iptables-mode. The kubelet's `--cluster-dns` value is **unchanged** — pods continue resolving via the kube-dns Service ClusterIP. NLD installs NOTRACK iptables rules on a dummy `nodelocaldns` interface that binds both `169.254.20.10` and the kube-dns Service ClusterIP. While the NLD pod is not yet ready (or fails), DNS queries fall through gracefully to cluster CoreDNS via the unchanged kube-dns Service Endpoints. There is no scheduling deadlock to protect against, so no startup taint is needed.

**Cold-pull race on fresh Karpenter nodes**: The image (`registry.k8s.io/dns/k8s-dns-node-cache:1.26.8`, ~50MB) is lazy-pulled via the Harbor proxy cache — it is **not** pre-mirrored to ECR. On a brand-new node, NLD typically sees ~30-60s of `ImagePullBackOff` until `registry-mirror-config` writes containerd's `hosts.toml` and the proxy-cache pull succeeds. During that window, pods on the node continue to use cluster CoreDNS via the unchanged kube-dns Service — no pod-visible failure, just no per-node cache yet.

**Tolerations**: explicit list (NOT `operator: Exists`) — `CriticalAddonsOnly`, `nvidia.com/gpu`, `node-fleet`, `instance-type`, `git-cache-not-ready`. Covers all standard runner/buildkit/GPU taints so it schedules at provisioning time.

### NVIDIA Device Plugin (GPU nodes only)

**File**: `base/kubernetes/nvidia-device-plugin.yaml`

Exposes `nvidia.com/gpu` resources to the Kubernetes scheduler. Without this DaemonSet, GPU workloads cannot request GPU resources and will not schedule. Runs only on nodes with label `nvidia.com/gpu: "true"`. Tolerates `git-cache-not-ready` so it starts during the warm-up period.

### Registry Mirror Config

**File**: `base/kubernetes/registry-mirror-config.yaml`

Configures containerd's `certs.d/` on every node to route image pulls through Harbor's proxy cache at `localhost:30002`. Covers six registries: docker.io, ghcr.io, public.ecr.aws, nvcr.io, registry.k8s.io, quay.io. Uses a marker file for idempotency. If Harbor is unavailable, containerd falls through to upstream registries automatically.

Runs on ALL nodes (no nodeSelector, tolerates everything).

### Node Performance Tuning

**File**: `base/kubernetes/node-performance-tuning.yaml`

Runs a privileged init container (`tune-node`) that configures:
- CPU governor set to `performance`
- Kubelet static CPU manager policy verification
- Topology manager policy verification
- NVIDIA GPU persistence mode (GPU nodes only)

Runs on nodes with `workload-type` in `[github-runner, buildkit]`.

### algif_aead Module Blacklist (TEMPORARY — CVE-2026-31431)

**File**: `base/kubernetes/algif-mitigation.yaml`

Writes `/etc/modprobe.d/disable-algif.conf` (`install algif_aead /bin/false`) and defensively `modprobe -r algif_aead` on every node. Mitigates CVE-2026-31431 ("Copy Fail" — Linux kernel `algif_aead` LPE that crosses container boundaries via the shared page cache). Privileged init container `nsenter`'s into PID 1's namespaces to operate on the host kernel.

Runs on ALL nodes (no nodeSelector, tolerates everything). Idempotent via `/var/lib/algif-mitigation/.configured` marker.

**TODO — REMOVE this DaemonSet** once all nodes are running an AL2023 AMI with kernel 6.12.85+. Watch https://explore.alas.aws.amazon.com/CVE-2026-31431.html and the AMI pinnings tagged with the same TODO marker (`clusters.yaml`, `modules/nodepools/scripts/python/generate_nodepools.py`, `modules/buildkit/scripts/python/generate_buildkit.py`, `modules/pypi-cache/kubernetes/ec2nodeclass.yaml.tpl`).

## Taint Summary

| Taint Key | Type | Effect | Scope | Removed By |
|-----------|------|--------|-------|------------|
| `git-cache-not-ready=true` | Startup taint | `NoSchedule` | All Karpenter NodePools | git-cache-warmer DaemonSet |
| `instance-type={type}` | Permanent | `NoSchedule` | ARC runner NodePools | Never (scheduling constraint) |
| `node-fleet={fleet}` | Permanent | `NoSchedule` | ARC runner NodePools | Never (fleet-based scheduling) |
| `workload/buildkit-{arch}=true` | Permanent | `NoSchedule` | BuildKit NodePools | Never (scheduling constraint) |
| `nvidia.com/gpu=true` | Permanent | `NoSchedule` | GPU NodePools only — applied by both the standard `generate_nodepools.py` (g4dn, g5, g6, p4d) and the specialized H100 (`modules/nodepools-h100`) and B200 (`modules/nodepools-b200`) generators. H100/B200 pools also pin `topology_manager_policy: single-numa-node` (scope `pod`) instead of the runner default (`best-effort`/`container`). | Never (scheduling constraint) |
| `node-compactor.osdc.io/consolidating=true` | Runtime (dynamic) | `NoSchedule` | Applied by node-compactor | node-compactor controller (protected by `min_node_age`: 900s) |
| `CriticalAddonsOnly=true` | Permanent | `NoSchedule` | Base infrastructure nodes (EKS-managed) | Never |

## Toleration Pattern

All DaemonSets targeting runner and buildkit nodes use a consistent toleration set covering `instance-type`, `node-fleet` (runner NodePools) and `workload/buildkit-*` (BuildKit NodePools) taints:

```yaml
tolerations:
  - key: instance-type
    operator: Exists
    effect: NoSchedule
  - key: node-fleet
    operator: Exists
    effect: NoSchedule
  - key: workload/buildkit-arm64
    operator: Exists
    effect: NoSchedule
  - key: workload/buildkit-amd64
    operator: Exists
    effect: NoSchedule
  - key: nvidia.com/gpu
    operator: Exists
    effect: NoSchedule
  - key: git-cache-not-ready
    operator: Exists
    effect: NoSchedule
  - key: karpenter.sh/unschedulable
    operator: Exists
    effect: NoSchedule
  - key: CriticalAddonsOnly
    operator: Exists
    effect: NoSchedule
  # Plus standard node condition taints
```

This ensures DaemonSet pods schedule on nodes immediately at provisioning time, before any startup taints are removed.

**Exception**: The `nodelocaldns` DaemonSet uses an **explicit** toleration list (NOT `operator: Exists` blanket-tolerating each key) — it explicitly tolerates `CriticalAddonsOnly`, `nvidia.com/gpu`, `node-fleet`, `instance-type`, and `git-cache-not-ready`. This is sufficient to cover all standard runner/buildkit/GPU NodePool taints. If a new permanent taint is added to any NodePool, NLD's toleration list must be updated explicitly.
